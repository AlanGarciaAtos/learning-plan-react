### Why components?

A component is a self-contained, reusable code block that divides the user interface into smaller pieces rather than building the entire UI in a single file.

**Reusability:**
Don't repeat yourself
<br>

**Separation of Concerns:**
Don't do too many things in one and the same place ( function )

Split big chunks of code into
multiple smaller functions

A _declarative_ style, like what react has, allows you to control flow and state in your application by saying "It should look like this" (let react figure it out).
<br>
An _imperative_ style turns that around and allows you to control your application by saying "This is what you should do".

**Declarative approach his is great analogy:**

> An imperative response: Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a left. Get on I-15 south until you get to the Bangerter Highway exit. Take a right off the exit like youâ€™re going to Ikea. Go straight and take a right at the first light. Continue through the next light then take your next left. My house is #298.

> A declarative response: My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Draper Utah 84020\*
